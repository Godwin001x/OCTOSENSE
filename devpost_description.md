# OctoSense — Devpost Project Description

**OctoSense** is a prototype PWA that simulates an AI-powered flood early-warning and relief coordination platform for vulnerable communities.

**What it does (MVP):**
- Visualizes flood risk zones on an interactive map using free OpenStreetMap tiles and sample weather data.
- Provides a local AI-simulated prediction of flood risk (deterministic logic based on rainfall & humidity).
- Allows community members to submit reports of rising water or blocked drains (saved locally in prototype).
- Includes an on-site AI Assistant (rule-based chatbot) that gives safety tips and guidance.

**Why it matters:** Floods are increasing in frequency and severity. OctoSense demonstrates how low-cost, AI-augmented tools can provide early warnings, inform communities, and coordinate relief in low-resource settings.

**Tech:** Next.js, Tailwind, Leaflet/OpenStreetMap, Flask (Python), simple rule-based AI logic. No paid APIs required for the prototype.

**Demo link:** (Include Vercel + Render links if deployed)

**Team:** Godwin Kamau (Developer) — Prototype built using free tools and mock data to demonstrate concept and UX.
